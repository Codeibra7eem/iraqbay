### Plan for Current Request

The user requested to create a full functional multi-vendor e-commerce app named IQbay. Due to the complexity of the backend, this prototype focuses on the frontend.

**Steps Taken:**

1. Created the Flutter project `iqbay`.
2. Set up basic navigation in `main.dart`.
3. Created placeholder files for `home_page.dart`, `product_listing_page.dart`, and `product_detail_page.dart`.
4. Added navigation buttons to `home_page.dart`.
5. Created this `blueprint.md` file.

### Next Steps (Frontend Prototype - UI Refinement):

Implement actual functionality (requires backend integration).
Refine the UI of all pages for a more polished look and feel.
